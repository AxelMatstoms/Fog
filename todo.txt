# Left
- A way to track memory allocations
- A simple abstracted renderer with render commands, that can draw sprites.
    - OpenGL
    - Shaders
    - Textures
    - Simple text
- Asset system, preprocessing of assets
- Send up a texture array (3D texture) for sprites, with ids.
- Sound
- Asset system for handling textures and sprite data

Renderer, update buffers every frame:
    Primitives: lines, points, and quads
    Pass: Transform, uv (x, y), tint, time?, sheet?
    3D texture for text, sprites, animations etc... ?
    Maybe sort by the sheet instead?
    Requirements, ~1000000 particles on screen, lightning fast
    easy to work with.

# DONE
- Simple input system with controller support [DONE]
